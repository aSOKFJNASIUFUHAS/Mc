    "1.12.2-latest": "1.3.10",
    "1.12.2-recommended": "1.3.10"
  }
  ,"1.12.2":{
	"1.3.2":"Fixed the Sprout mobs spawning insane amounts.  Golems will no longer shoot through walls, their projectiles now have block collision.  Guardian of Sprites will no longer bump and push players around in creative.  Guardian of Sprites will now despawn in peaceful mode.  Fixed owls spamming eggs; they now have laying rates increased to between 500 and 900 seconds randomly (still only on leaves).   Lingering potions spawned from certain rainbow slimes no longer last forever, also they make the potion splash sound when starting.  Fixed Timber Wolves duplicating on world reload.  Fixed Timber Wolves spawning way too much.  Fixed timber wolves dealing zero damage.  Temporarily disabled the taming and breeding of Timber Wolves since it was buggy (will revisit in later update.)	 Many more config flags added to control mob behavior.   "
    ,"1.3.3":"Fixed the green flying Sprites so that they do despawn as normal (previously they would NEVER despawn, making it look like they were multiplying or spawning in mass numbers).  Sprites now only spawn in darkness, instead of ignoring light levels.   Fixed some flying mobs and the camo Slimes not working with the spawn rate configs.  Reduced attack frequency of Dire Wolf.  	 Fixed issues with the mod using biomeWhitelist configs not affecting some mobs.   Changed several default config values changed for balance reasons; does not change existing config files (Attack damage and health reduced for several mobs; some default spawn rates reduced).  Changed timberwolf egg color slightly so it stands out more.  Added spawn eggs to a creative tab.  Fixed Mini enderman not loading its loot table.    Bigger sprites are now a different color to help tell the difference from smaller ones.  Fixed Sprites using hardcoded 3.0 damage instead of reading from config.  Sprites will no longer attack creative mode players and cause them knockback.  	Guardian of Sprites should no longer forget to drop Totem of Undying.  "
	,"1.3.4":"Fixed Fallen Knights doing zero attack damage; also now they never spawn with a bow.  Added movement speed to the config file for many mobs.  Added Turkish tr_TR.lang (thanks RoCoKo). "
	,"1.3.5":"Updated mob AI registration (moved from constructor to init) which should reduce AI breaks such as spinning on ledges and other navigation issues.  Fixed fallen mounts doing zero damage and just nudging the player around.  Fallen Knights are more likely to dismount when in combat in order to be more deadly.  New Fallen Knight config ChanceBow, defaults to 40% chance of having a bow instead of melee.  "
	,"1.3.6":"Fixed a server crash when you tame a Fairy with glowstone.   Fixed the loot table for Toxic Witch failing to load.  Fixed Frozen Skeleton causing errors when interacting with Mob Grinders / Fake Players.  Frozen Skeleton no longer has Zombie sounds.  "
	,"1.3.7":"Wither witch has new configs maxCats and minCats to control pet creation at spawn time.  Fixed an AI priority conflict with Fallen Knight.   Fixed Fallen Knight getting dismounted when mount tries to attack.   Removed ChanceBow for Fallen Knight (this was not in original release, was added recently and never worked right), now mob is always melee.  "
	,"1.3.8":"Minimum forge version is now 14.23.1.2594.  Greatly reduced movement speed of fallen knights."
	,"1.3.9":"Creature loot_tables registered publicly so they are compatible with zenscript mods such as LootTweaker.  "
	,"1.3.10":"tr_TR language updated by RoCoKo.  Fix broken loot tables on some slimes and the green sprout."
	}

	"1.0.93": "- Lumberjacks will check a larger area for leaves to break when approaching trees. However, they will no longer break leaves that cannot decay (ones placed by hand)\n- Fixed bug with world scanned blocks (logs, sugarcane, saplings) not having their claims released correctly.\n- Improved tree detection to check for decayable leaves only\n- Impoved Sapling detection for druids looking to grow trees.\n- Reduced Bard leveling rates",
	"1.0.92": "- PUBLIC RELEASE CANDIDATE. Please help test\n- CraftStudio jar file is now embedded in the TekTopia jar file. The separate jar file is no longer necessary.\n- Guards should no longer rotate and lose there minds when attempting to run to enemies.\n- When logging in for the first time a player will now receive a brief and inadequate book pointing them to the wiki.\n- Ranchers will lead mooshrooms to the cow pen now\n- Increased Chef's beetroot soup storage goal from 3 to 15\n- Fixed rendering issues with Patreon rancher hat\n- The butcher no longer requires a villager axe to produce villager meat and goods.\n- The recipe for the Storage structure has been put back into the game. This should only be necessary if you lose or blow up your free one from the Town Hall starter chest.\n- The Bard will now get unhappy if their performances are not appreciated by sufficient people\n- The Mod will now know when it is out of date within the game. See the blinking green star to see that a new version is available.\n- Patch notes are now included in game",
	"1.0.91": "- Crowding checks have been enabled\n- Slightly increased the frequency which villagers can get unhappy doing their jobs",
	"1.0.90": "### The two features marked !! are implemented but currently disabled. They will be enabled next patch (very soon).  Make your adjustments asap ###\n- !! Villager will now become unhappy with overcrowding in structures. Most structures require 12 floor tiles per villager.\n  If that ratio is not met, the villagers inside will become unhappy. Sleeping villagers are unaffected. More details will be put up on the wiki.\n- !! Villagers will also now become unhappy with low ceilings. Structures with average ceiling height lower than 2.5 air blocks will cause unhappiness.\n- Chefs now craft golden apples\n- Guards will now pick up 1 villager golden apple. If they drop below 50% health they will eat it for Regen 1 for 10 seconds and Absorption for 2 minutes\n- Added patreon promotion event at the 10th profession token purchase\n- Tons of foundation code for Patreon exclusive features post launch\n- Fixed crash with teacher teaching with books.\n- Guards will now stop attacking a target or armor stand when their hunger is below 10 instead of 0\n- Lumberjacks will see less gains in log drops as they level up. High level lumberjacks will still require less swings to down a tree, but will now receive the same percentage of logs from that tree.\n- Tweaked large oak tree chopping.  Now only logs adjacent to leaves will be broken and less buildings.\n- Skeletons converted by the necromancer have had their range halved.\n- Villagers will no longer lose hunger if the storage room isn't loaded. This should hopefully prevent some rare starvation cases",
	"1.0.87": "- Guards will craft wooden swords again as necessary.\n- Villagers converted with a profession token will retain previous traits again (Bug from last patch)\n- Children will no longer grow up after 4-5 days worth of server ticks. Instead they will grow up after experiencing 4-5 unique days.\n- Chefs will now return the correct number of villager buckets when a non villager cake is made.\n- Villagers have developed a fear of the nether and refuse to teleport there now.\n- Guards now have a specific set of AI filters to control what gear they equip\n- Guards now consider enchantments when choosing armor and weapons. \n- Removed the condition where the Necromancer would self despawn.  If you find a way to abuse the Necro AI please let me know."
